# Token Refresh & Update Check

This page covers two unrelated kinds of "update": refreshing your **Codex login token**, and checking for a **new version of this app**.

## Token refresh is manual

Unlike the Claude version this app was adapted from, **Codex Usage Monitor never refreshes your login token automatically.** Refreshing requires `codex login`, which is interactive and cannot be run safely in the background.

You normally do not have to do anything:

- The **Codex CLI refreshes `~/.codex/auth.json` on its own** while it runs. As long as you use Codex periodically, the access token the app reads stays valid.
- If the token **does expire**, the app keeps working by **falling back to your local session data** (the newest `rate_limits` snapshot in `~/.codex/sessions/.../rollout-*.jsonl`). These numbers are as fresh as your last Codex turn, and need no token or network. See [`usage_source`](configuration.md#usage-data-source).
- To get a fresh token, just run **`codex login`** again in a terminal. The app picks up the new token on its next poll - no restart required.

The app itself contacts only `chatgpt.com`; it never performs an OAuth login flow and never writes `auth.json`.

## Optional app-version update check

The app does not phone home to check for new releases - it communicates exclusively with `chatgpt.com`. Update checking is available as an optional PowerShell script that you run via [event commands](event-commands.md). This keeps the security model intact while giving you full control over when and how updates are checked.

The script queries the GitHub Releases API, compares the latest version against the running app version, and shows a Windows toast notification if a newer release exists. Clicking the notification opens the download page in your browser. If no update is available or the network is unreachable, nothing happens.

### Setup

#### 1. Save the script

Save the following as `check-update.ps1` next to your `CodexUsageMonitor.exe` (or in the project root when running from source):

```powershell
$currentVersion = if ($env:USAGE_MONITOR_VERSION) { $env:USAGE_MONITOR_VERSION } else { '0.0.0' }

$releaseUrl = 'https://api.github.com/repos/omi-last-stand/codex-usage-monitor/releases/latest'

try {
    $release = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $releaseUrl -TimeoutSec 10
    $latest = $release.tag_name -replace '^v', ''

    if ([version]$latest -gt [version]$currentVersion) {
        # Windows requires a registered app ID for toast notifications
        $notifierAppId = 'Microsoft.Windows.ControlPanel'

        [Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotificationManager, Windows.UI.Notifications, ContentType = WindowsRuntime] > $null
        [Windows.Data.Xml.Dom.XmlDocument, Windows.Data.Xml.Dom, ContentType = WindowsRuntime] > $null

        $xml = [Windows.Data.Xml.Dom.XmlDocument]::new()
        $xml.LoadXml("<toast activationType='protocol' launch='$($release.html_url)'>
            <visual><binding template='ToastGeneric'>
                <text>Codex Usage Monitor</text>
                <text>Version $latest available (current: $currentVersion)</text>
            </binding></visual>
        </toast>")

        [Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotificationManager]::CreateToastNotifier($notifierAppId).Show(
            [Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotification]::new($xml)
        )
    }
}
catch {
    # Silently ignore - update check is optional
}
```

The app automatically sets the `USAGE_MONITOR_VERSION` environment variable for all event commands, so the script always knows the currently running version without hardcoding it.

#### 2. Configure the event command

Add the script to your [`usage-monitor-settings.json`](configuration.md). Choose when to check based on your preference:

**Check on every quota reset** (the primary window resets roughly every 5 hours):

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\check-update.ps1"
}
```

**Check only on weekly resets** (once every 7 days):

```json
{
  "on_reset_command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\check-update.ps1 && if not \"%USAGE_MONITOR_VARIANT%\"==\"seven_day\" exit /b"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have an `on_reset_command`, use an array to run both:
> ```json
> {
>   "on_reset_command": [
>     "your-existing-command",
>     "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\check-update.ps1"
>   ]
> }
> ```

#### 3. Restart the app

Use the **Restart** option in the tray context menu to load the new settings.

### How it works

1. On each configured event, the app launches the script as a background process (no console window, no focus stealing)
2. The script sends a single HTTPS request to `https://api.github.com/repos/omi-last-stand/codex-usage-monitor/releases/latest`
3. If the latest release tag is newer than `USAGE_MONITOR_VERSION`, a toast notification appears
4. Clicking the notification opens the GitHub release page in your default browser
5. If the request fails (no internet, API down, rate-limited), the script exits silently

The script never downloads or installs anything automatically.

### Customizing the notification appearance

Toast notifications display the icon and name of a registered Windows app. The script uses `Microsoft.Windows.ControlPanel` by default, which shows as "Settings" with a gear icon.

To use a different app's appearance, change the `$notifierAppId` value in the script. Find available app IDs on your system with:

```powershell
Get-StartApps
```

Some examples:

| `$notifierAppId` | Appears as |
|---|---|
| `Microsoft.Windows.ControlPanel` | Settings (gear icon) |
| `{1AC14E77-02E7-4E5D-B744-2EB1AE5198B7}\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` | Windows PowerShell |

### Security notes

- The script is a plain text file - you can read and verify every line before using it
- This optional script's only network request goes to `api.github.com` (GitHub's public API, no authentication required). The app itself still talks only to `chatgpt.com`
- No data is sent to GitHub beyond the standard HTTPS request
- The script never writes files, modifies settings, or downloads executables
- Errors are silently ignored - a failed update check never affects the app
